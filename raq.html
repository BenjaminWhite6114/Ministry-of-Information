	  <h1>Rarely Asked Questions</h1>
	  <p>We get many questions here at the Ministry of Information, such as "what?", "why?" or "who would do such a thing?", but these questions are so rarely put through the proper channels. Information is power, and we must be careful of which hands we place that power in. It is for that reason that we are especially careful with what information
	  is made publicly available. Of the few properly filed requests for public releases of information we receive, only a portion are deemed safe for public disemmination. This pages hosts the answers to those so rarely asked questions.</p>
