	  <h1>Rarely Asked Questions</h1>
	  <p>We get many questions here at the Ministry of Information, such as "what?", "why?" or "who would do such a thing?", but these questions are so rarely put through the proper channels. Information is power, and we must be careful of which hands we place that power in. It is for that reason that we are especially careful with what information
	  is made publicly available. Of the few properly filed requests for public releases of information we receive, only a portion are deemed safe for public disemmination. This pages hosts the answers to those so rarely asked questions.</p>
	</div>

	  <h1>How do I navigate the Ministry of Information website?</h1>
	  <p>Simple, once you've navigated to the home page, one only needs a mouse and keyboard to surf the seas of information! Using the scroll wheel on your mouse, you can navigate up and down any given page on the site. If the page you're on doesn't have the information you're looking for, try clicking one of the tabs on the sidebar to navigate to
	  an alternative page.</p>
